# First chapter: Introduction
## Objects to manipulate
- Points
- Line
- Segment
- Triangle
- Disks
- Polygons...

We can see that points create most of the objects that we manipulate and with disks we introduce the concept of distance (because it's represented by the central point and a radius)

## Models of computation
- Turing Machine
- RAM Model $\to$ integers
- $\lambda$-calculus

The RAM model uses integers so it can be difficult to represent irrational numbers (like Pythagoras).

- Ruler & Compass

This model uses Euclid operations to create whatever geometric constructions it exists (with a ruler and compass).

- Real-RAM (abstract, no machine can represent real numbers)

There are some problems that proves the importance of those 2 models, some problems are easy to solve in one model and viceversa.

- [Squaring the circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaring_the_circle)
- [Angle trisection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_trisection)
- [Doubling the cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubling_the_cube)

With the Real-RAM Model we can do those operations:$+$, $-$, $\times$, /, $\sqrt{}$, $\sin$, $\cos$, $\pi$. $\to$ the square root calculation is expensive. If we add the floor function, we can solve $NP$-complete problems in polynomial time (the model would be too powerful).

## Main operations that we are going to use

- Norm: $|a| = \sqrt{a_x^2 + a_x^2}$
- Scalar product: $(a_x, a_y)\dot{} (b_x, b_y) = a_xb_x + a_yb_y = |a||b|\sin{\theta}$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors.
- Cross product: $a \times b = \begin{bmatrix}
    1_x &   1_y & 1_z \\
    a_x &   a_y & a_z \\
    b_x &   b_y & b_z \\
\end{bmatrix}$

/!\ Important: $|a\times b| = |a||b|sin{\theta}$

$a\times b = 1_z \begin{vmatrix} a_x & a_y \\ b_x & b_y \end{vmatrix} = (a_xb_y - a_yb_x)1_z$

To find the sinus of an angle now we can just calculate it with all the equivalences. Given that we have 3 points u, v and w.

$$a = v-u\\
b = w-u\\
a\times b = v_xw_y - u_xw_y - v_xu_y + u_xu_y - v_yw_x + v_yu_x + u_yw_x - u_yu_x = \begin{vmatrix} u_x & u_y & 1\\
v_x & v_y & 1\\
w_x & w_y & 1 \end{vmatrix}$$

# Convexity

 Having group C:

 $$C\  \text{is convex iff}\ \ \  \forall a,b\in C [ab] \subseteq C\\
 [ab] = \{\lambda a + (1-\lambda)b : 0 \leq \lambda \leq 1\}$$

**Convex combination**:

$$
    \forall P_1, P_2, \dots, P_n = \{\lambda_1P_1+\lambda_2P_2+\dots+\lambda_nP_n : \lambda_1 + \dots + \lambda_n = 1\ \  \lambda_i \geq 0\}
$$


**Convex Hull**:

The Convex Hull of $S = \{P_1, \dots, P_n\}$ is the smallest convex set that contains S. We can also say that the Convex Hull of a set S is the intersection of all convex sets that contain S:

$$CH(S) = \bigcap_{\substack{C\  \text{convex} \\ S \subseteq C}} C$$

#HOMEWORK:

Click on 3 points and then have a script that says if it is a right turn or a left turn.
