# Lower Bounds

Last time we have proven that Convex Hull cannot be solved faster than $O(n\log n)$.

Sorting takes $\Omega(n\log n)$. Nevertheless, changing the model (without comparisons) the problem can be solved on linear time (see [Bucket sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_sort)).

## How to beat Lower Bounds

1. Change model
2. Change problem (approximation algorithms)
3. Change how you measure running time
    - Jarvis march works on $O(nH)$ where $H$ is the number of points on CH.
    - Graham scan works on $O(n\log n)$. We can say that if $H=\log n$ Graham Scan becomes better (???).

    You can see that Jarvis March's complexity is output sensitive (it depends on the size of the CH).

### Comparing running time

The brute force approach: We can run both of the algorithms in the same time and kill the process who finishes last -> take the first one.

[T. Chan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_M._Chan) got an idea to get an optimal algorithm in $O(n\log H)$:
- Imagine you know what $H$ is.
- Graham Scan takes $H\log H$, we compute that on an arbitrary group of $H$ points.
- We do this $\frac{n}{H}$ times so we will have $\frac{n}{H}$ Convex Hulls.
- We have now $O(H\log H)$ for each group, we do this $n$ times so the new complexity is $O(\frac{n}{H}H\log H)=O(n\log H)$.
- We do now Jarvis March on this, taking each time the tangent of the chosen point with every convex hull -> $H(\frac{n}{H}\log H)=O(n\log H)$.

BONUS: [Exponential search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_search).

With exponential search, we take time: (take prats notes mdr)


## Beating Lower Bounds

Recall: Finding point in complex polygon (not convex) is $\Omega(n)$. Draw a line from outside and count if even or odd the intersections with polygon (inside or outside).

Now we want to analyse this problem in the case we want to find if $n$ points are inside the polygon by batching.

This algorithm is called *Plane Sweep*:

**PLANE SWEEP**: (in the case of orthogonal polygons)
- *Input*: A polygon of size $n$ + $n$ points.
- *Output*: for each point determine if it is inside or out.

![Plane weep](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Konstantinos_Kakoulis/publication/299499230/figure/fig7/AS:350354463051776@1460542421011/The-step-of-the-plane-sweep-algorithm-that-resolves-overlaps-for-Label-2.png)

We "sweep" the plane with a line and each time we find a new event (point or line) we scan. We must take into consideration:
1. Events queue
2. Sweepline data structure

The algorithm then is simple:

````
create events queue
while there is an event
    process the event
    update the sweepline DS
````

**EVENTS**:
- Polygon vertices (array with vertices in order)
    - If left endpoint: Then add it to the sweepline DS
    - If right endpoint: Then delete it from the sweepline DS
- Query point
    - Find segment just below point.

So the data structure of the sweepline will be a *Binary Search Tree* $\to$ *Red-Black Tree* (because they balance themselves $\to O(log n)$ operations).

In the case we don't have orthogonal polygons we have to store diagonal segments: *Triangulation*

## Triangulation of simple polygons

How do we do it? Or better: *Can we do it?*

The answer: of course! How then?

**Proof by induction**:
We can take off a vertex, and suppose that the new polygon can be triangulated.

![ear](http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/teaching/cg-projects/97/Ian/triangulation.gif)

Each point that is taken off is an ear. We have just to take off the point and add it again to create this triangulation iteratively.

This is a constructive proof: the proof is actually the algorithm.

**THEOREM:** Every polygon of more than 4 vertices has at least two disjoint ears.

**PROOF:**
By induction:
- Base case: $n=4$
    - Convex or concave: it has 2 ears
- Assume every polygon with $< n$ vertices has more than 2 non overlapping ears.
    - Take a convex vertex of the polygon
        - If it is an ear: cut it off, there is another ear by induction.
        - If it is not an ear, we do same as the concave square and cut it. Then apply induction to both of them if they have $\geq 4$.
            - If we have less than 3 vertices -> those vertices are an ear.
    - Remark: disjoint convex vertex = turns left.
